# Loan-Prediction

To predict and classify whether the customer is eligible to obtain the loan or not based on the various factors about the customer. (The whole project is done using Python Language)

• Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to understand, clean and prepare our data for building model which involved steps like Variable identification , uni and bi-variate analysis , Missing values treatment, Outliers treatment, Variable Tranformation and Variable Creation.

• After EDA, Logistic Regression, Decision tree, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Random forest, Extra tree classifier, XGBM models were built and based on accuracy, Precision, recall, F1_score. An Ensemble Model was created combining KNN, SVM, Extra tree classifier and XGBM for best results.

• The project was deployed using Streamlit.
